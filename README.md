# Gauge and Go - Digital Information Leaflet 
This branch contains files used to create a website - the "digital information leaflet" - used in the submission process of this group project for CASA0019, Sensor Data Visualisation, at UCL.

The website is deployed to GitHub Pages, available at: https://ethan-se.github.io/ucl-east-food-queue-gauge/

The project files can be found on the [`main` branch of this repository](https://github.com/ethan-se/ucl-east-food-queue-gauge).
